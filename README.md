## HTML5

1. <details><summary><span class="large-text">What are semantic elements in html5?</span></summary>

   Semantic elements in HTML5 are tags that add meaning to the structure of web documents beyond their visual representation. By using these elements, developers can create more descriptive and organized content, which benefits developers, users who rely on **assistive technologies** and **search engines** which can lead to a better search engine rankings.

   Some of the key semantic elements include _header_, _nav_, _main_ and _section_. Some non semantic elements are _div_ and _span_.

2. <details><summary><span class="large-text">What is doctype in html5?</span></summary>

   In HTML5, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is used to specify the type and version of the HTML being used in the web document. The purpose of the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is to tell the web browser which version of HTML to expect and how to parse and render the content.

   Including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration in your HTML documents is important because it ensures that modern web browsers interpret and render the content correctly.

3. <details><summary><span class="large-text">What is block and inline elements?</span></summary>

   Block-level elements create blocks of content that stack vertically, taking up the full width of their parent container, while inline elements flow within the text and do not create new lines.

   Common block-level elements include _div_, _p_, _header_ and _section_.

   Common inline elements include _span_, _img_, _br_ and _input_.

4. <details><summary><span class="large-text">What is the datalist tag?</span></summary>

   The `datalist` tag is an HTML5 element that is used in conjunction with the `input` element to provide a predefined list of options for user input. It allows web developers to create a dropdown list of options that users can select from while entering data in an input field. The `datalist` element is particularly useful for autocompletion or suggesting valid options to users, thereby improving the user experience and data entry efficiency.

5. <details><summary><span class="large-text">What is the class and id attribute?</span></summary>

   In HTML, the class and id attributes are used to add specific identifying information to elements, allowing developers to apply CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to those elements.

   You use IDs when you need unique identification for an element, and classes when you want to group elements with shared characteristics.
